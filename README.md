# H750_BME280_example

See [this thread](https://twitter.com/Kongduino/status/1607230479757115393) for background.

I am learning the ins and outs of the STM32H750, on a WeAct Studio board – quite a nice board I gotta say. After adding separately an OLED and a BME280, I combined everything into this little project.
